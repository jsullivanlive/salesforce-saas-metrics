salesforce-saas-metrics
=======================

As a salesforce consultant you have implemented the same reports too many times.

This package is a cumulation of best practice reports and logic for saas companies so that you can start from a baseline focused on saas.

Development
-----------

You will need your own developer or sandbox org.  Connect eclipse to your org, checkout this git repo inside your project folder, and then deploy the files to your org.

This repo is AGPL, so you have to contribute changes back.
